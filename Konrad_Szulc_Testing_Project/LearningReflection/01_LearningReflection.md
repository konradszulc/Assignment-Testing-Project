> Please use the below questions as guidelines to help you think and plan your Learning Reflection Report

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?

    -  Generally the experience went quite well, as GitLab seems to be very well made and stable webapp. While I was new to registering or interacting with GitLab, the user interface was quite clear and beginner friendly. This is also because of added tutorials when being a new user. With the module material, provided examples and ease of use with GitLab, the experience was relatively smooth as a beginner tester in software. As well, I find the interface is very similar to that of GitHub, allowing me ease of locating the correct pages depending on the task at hand, but having the URL beforehand in the templates was useful.
     
## 2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.

    -  First I went over all module material, instructions and templates to get a general understanding of what is expecting of me. I then proceeded to browse GitLab before even testing to get a general feel for the website, where things are located and how responsive it is. I then proceeded to go in a down the list type of action with creating the test case, and understanding what exactly we are testing in this specific test suite. However, I would sometimes go back and forth between test case and variables as I was doing the test on site to make the writing and style more clear. I wanted to be as thorough as possible not only for the assignment but for the benefit of my learning, and future when needing to refer back to work I have done to understand the thought process. So once I understood the whole basics of the suite, I proceeded to run tests, and would incrementally add what was needed on the document as I did the tests one by one. I tried to focus on smaller tasks one at a time to not get confused or jumbled trying to manage multiple different tasks. Once was all completed I would run the test again to make sure I did not miss anything and double check for any typos to ensure the quality of written test cases. 
    
## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management. 

    -  As this is my first time writing test cases, I am not as familiar with other tools or styles, but decided to do some information gathering to understand the other options. As I understand the style we use based off templates is the Robot Framework (https://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html) which is python based and can be quite useful for automative testing, while in this project scenario we were just doing manual testing, to be able to read for manual. I would have to make it more in line with what is expected in automative format to make sure there are no compile issues. From first usage, I find that it can be quite beginner friendly and something I may use in the future. In addition, XRay by Sembi seems to be a high quality software designed for Agile Testing as shown on their website https://www.getxray.app/solutions/agile-testing provides the ability for users to work efficiently while still collaborating effectively, by displaying up-to-date results and statuses. As well, that can convert different types of testing scenarios into Jira issues to increase work flow productivity. For styles, while being a novice, manual testing is a great way to understand the process, and what may not be really said for automated testing, but great for another human to understand since it is straightforward and easy to follow, especially with testing such as the whole process of logging in. However, something I noticed from the presentation from Shuang is how efficient automated tests can be especially in white box testing, for like regression tests. The ability to run scripts to then test software, and find defects in a process that otherwise would take much longer if just manual going through it is absolutely necessary in such high paced work environments, when especially in agile testing, need to be quick and incremental.

## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?

    -  I have used Visual Code as my IDE for a multitude of reasons, one is it is the most IDE program I am comfortable with. This is especially the case because with all courses in Laurea, have recommended and required Visual Code, thus I know my way around the UI. However, there are still noticeable features that are great within Visual Code, such as easy and seamless transition with GitHub, customizable display both with colors and different split views to increase productivity. Furthermore, plenty of add ons to fully bring features I want, this may not be needed for this assignment, but installing add ons like common snippets are beneficial to increase work flow. I have had no issues with Visual Code and find it to operate well with managing files, adding or modifying. I am of the personality that if it is not broken don't fix it, as Visual code provides everything I need I have not tried any others.

## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?

    -  I think my biggest trouble with this assignment was just more of the newer terms and organizing them properly. For while I learned quite a bit of new knowledge within the modules both the textbook and videos, actually writing the standard tags or standard way of data, and test cases was all new to me. I really appreciated the latest presentation from Shuang in the course because it help to reinforce that every workplace has different standards or approached to testing, but there are still basic frameworks to understand completely. Thus with a bit of repetition of the module content and templates, I feel I was able to produce clear and intricate details for each of the TO DO tasks, atleast for manual testing approach. At first I was also concerned about potential difficulties with GitLab, but after playing around with it beforehand, and how user friendly it is, I did not have any issues to performing the tests, just new experiences which take time.

## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?

    -  In the last year and a half at Laurea, I have used GitHub extensively as a great way to collaborate with teammates, and to manage different projects being stored online. Thus, all the git commands, and set up of Repos are not new to me, making the process of uploading my documents not a problem at all. I have used it in various other projects for website development, app development, and coding projects. I also use it personally for some personal projects and to view other open source projects out of general curiosity. Thus, in terms of Github there were no troubles.
 
## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )
    
    - Considering I have some prior knowledge of python through courses and my own learning, I would want to choose a framework that compliments that skill which is Robot Framework. As I am now in the process of utilizing this framework, and seems to be more beginner friendly, it is a great starting point in utilizing it as a beginning learning experience when automating. As well, with how popular it is, there is plenty of documentation to help me troubleshoot any issues I have. I think it is important for a novice such as myself to start with less complicated and familiar frameworks. But then later down the line can transition to adding SeleniumLibrary to the Robot Framework as mentioned by Divya Panchal (2025) using SeleniumLibrary to integrate more complex features such as web automation capabilities to do various events on a web browser, which would be great for these test scenarios.

## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing

    -  While the job market is quite bad in Finland currently, I expanded the search to also wider market just to get a better idea of the skills and competencies needed. When I searched these terms some of the things in demand were:

        - Full proficiency in at least one programming language
        - Strong Understanding of testing methodologies and SDLC (software development life cycle)
        - Good Verbal English Communication Skills
        - Familiarity with bug-tracking tools like Jira, or Trello
        - Past Experience in Agile Methodologies
        - Familiarity with testing REST and SOAP services using different frameworks.

    Overall, it seems that when looking to be a tester, understanding a wide arrange of tools, while also being able to explain yourself clearly and coherently in a fast agile environment, are the most important aspects to companies seeking testers. Especially with automation testing, programming seemed to be more essential because scripts and such are needed to create and perform automatic tests.

## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?

    -  I definitely believe having some coding experience is beneficial even if were not focusing mainly on white box testing. This is just to be understanding of the process, and potential bugs or defects that can occur in code, and where maybe to find them. As well, when it comes to automatic testing, the ability to create scripts needed for running the tests and having a idea of code to get the whole test coverage. Soft Skills such as writing comprehensive bug reports, presentations, Communicative skills to teammates or stakeholders is absolutely necessary to get the point across, explain current standings in projects or explain current issues in the software development life cycle. Furthermore, getting experience with multiple different testing tools and styles, as seen in the question above, companies are requesting this as necessary to preform responsibilities and tasks associated with the job. Though I have mentioned that every company may have different processes and standards, still having fundamental knowledge of as many frameworks and tools is beneficial to cast a wide net in the software testing job pool.

## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 

    - Overall, I am very pleased with the structure and content of this course. The structure was well paced and organized to tackling new subjects at appropriate times that were related to the content we previously learned. Understanding the different concepts of white box testing, black box testing, static analysis, dynamic testing, the various amounts of different techniques and the pros/cons of all necessary procedures in testing was truly interesting and beneficial to any career in IT even if not specifically a tester. I think the project allowed me to get a real sense for what an actual testing scenario might look like in a professional setting, such as the documentation of data, each procedure mapped out, and utilizing actual IT service. While of course it may not be as difficult in a dedicated job, it's a great starting point for a novice like myself to learn from mistakes and garner appropriate feedback. I think the quizzes of the course, provided great knowledge checks, to see if there were any areas of the course may require more studying, and the percipio videos were high quality for a great watcher experience. I feel confident in the starting foundational knowledge of software testing, and may go for my ISTQB certifications in the future.
